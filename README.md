# Machine Learning
  This repository contains my machine learning projects and practice sets. It is primarily done with uisng python and libraries such as matplotlib, numpy and pandas

## Future Goals
  The goal is to learn all of the ML models and techniques possible.
  To learn pytorch, sckit-learn, tensorFlow, etc and file formats such as ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)
  To mae the same with C++ instead of python.
